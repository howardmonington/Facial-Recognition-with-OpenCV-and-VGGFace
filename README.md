# Facial Recognition with OpenCV and VGGFace

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to use OpenCV in order to identify a face and eyes in a picture. Then combine OpenCV with the VGGFace Neural Network in order to perform one shot learning and idenfity faces in a webcam feed.


### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Utilizing Pretrained Models
* Face and Eye Detection
* Facial Recognition

### Technologies
* Python
* jupyter
* Matplotlib
* JavaScript
* OpenCV
* VGG Face Neural Network
